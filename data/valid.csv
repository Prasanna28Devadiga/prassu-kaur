i have
with the flick of our tongues. this is how we have the
 the type of lover i need
numb really
he called me
is a museum
no
soft enough
not these things before i met you. as if i did not remain all
between faith and
degrade other women
who tricked you
you are in the habit
yet the other is having sex
it is my identity and my liberation
or both
muscles tighten
our backs
and funny how people have more guts these days to undress
that even in a bed full of safety
 the first time
eyes like almonds
how capable we are of feeling
if thats what you want to do
arms that were not
i am the water you need
making gold out of it
looks the same
i am a museum full of art
understand this world broke you. it has been so hard on your
go
just bloom
when others succeed
i put my hands in his lap
for relatability
with yourself
accept yourself
of your pants
is not about how many people
you yell at her
its been practicing how to stay silent so long only so it could

doesnt give back what he takes she will recognize me in your
9. plan a trip.
youd rather have the
frustration. half begging me to stop. half tired and sick of it.
your art
the one youve never heard of
the very thought of you
as you were designed
seen as ugly
when theyre not looking
we all move forward when
i want to save you
you have spent enough nights
if she tries to keep her heart
 to the reader
every revolution
 there is nothing purer than that
neighbors. and they come running to the door to save us. baby
but you had your eyes shut
my mother had gotten so big in such little time
is how you make
14. stop crying at some point.
perhaps the saddest of all
feels like
 the rest of your life in someone elses stomach.
it means nothing to me if he loves you
when the most they can do is complement
searching for honey that
do not bother holding on to
ask if it feels good and i say yes so quickly it sounds
did i feel as empty
my father scooped me in his tree trunk arms and
 balance
the good thing about feeling in extremes is
 you belong only to yourself
that rolls off your
every exquisite detail
it aches for women helping women
so soft i turn into
is so erotic
for a relationship
the problem was
she looks at me with defeated eyes
would not come for you
my mind is forgetting
 solo performance
will break her. when she is tired of falling apart for a man that
our bodies touched
me like i am the center point of gravity and you are falling into
 the art of being empty
in these pages
book. find your favorite page in the soft spot between my

i am not the whiskey you want
i am confident i am over you. so much that some mornings i
i am nothing
and complete
and then
held my shoulders down
there are some nights i imagine what i might do if you showed
he placed his hands
instead. lie me down. lay me open like a map. and with your
touching me
not have to
out of love
ones looking. i imitate their moans. hollow and hungry. you

from the hunger of
you are with yourself
you will remain a dragon
he asks me to show him something
of man id want to raise my son to be like
cause they look so much
life is moving
never punch you in the stomach the way mine did. she will
between a womans legs
out of love
i dont know why
the rest of your life
but always pass through
it will make you weep
 we share the same wilting fingers
grow flowers out of mine so
i call sisters in order to be wanted
with honesty
are your own
how unafraid we are of breaking
make me feel
his eyes pore into mine
so often
rough and jungle wild
existence meant that little next to their curiosity of you.
to feed a lineage of women with
other womens bodies
for better reasons
you treat them like they
these feet
taste so good
is the most you have to be proud of when your
you give and give till
uplifts me
you might not have been my first love
through quivering lips thinking. isnt it such a tragic thing.
whether you were
you could have me
that thing that does not want you
if you give it time and

but sigh in relief
you were a dragon long before
finger trace the places you still want to **** out of me. kiss
they realize how real this is. how much of a storm you are and
not lost within them
pleasant and saddest thing
skin the color of earth
are those who live waiting
or simply dont want to
the only one
be with you
youre still alive is from the

they love you and
so powerful at such a young age
soft and as tender
i break gaze just as
tomorrow will never come
you must enter a relationship
pried open
any man even though the state
you have sadness
tell me how im
been
i could light a whole city
why do you think its okay to do both
