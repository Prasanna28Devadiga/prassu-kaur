i want to apologize to all the women
i have called pretty
before ive called them intelligent or brave
i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what youre born with
is the most you have to be proud of when your
spirit has crushed mountains
from now on i will say things like
you are resilient or you are extraordinary
not because i dont think youre pretty
but because you are so much more than that
