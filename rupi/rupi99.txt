i dont know what living a balanced life feels like
when i am sad
i dont cry i pour
when i am happy
i dont smile i glow
when i am angry
i dont yell i burn

the good thing about feeling in extremes is
when i love i give them wings
but perhaps that isnt
such a good thing cause
they always tend to leave
and you should see me
when my heart is broken
i dont grieve
i shatter
