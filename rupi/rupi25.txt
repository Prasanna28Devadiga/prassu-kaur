you look just like your mother

 i guess i do carry her tenderness well

you both have the same eyes

 cause we are both exhausted

and the hands

 we share the same wilting fingers

but that rage your mother doesnt wear that anger

 youre right
 this rage is the one thing
 i get from my father




 (homage to warsan shires inheritance)
