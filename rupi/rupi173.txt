apparently it is ungraceful of me
to mention my period in public
cause the actual biology
of my body is too real

it is okay to sell whats
between a womans legs
more than it is okay to
mention its inner workings

the recreational use of
this body is seen as
beautiful while
its nature is
seen as ugly
