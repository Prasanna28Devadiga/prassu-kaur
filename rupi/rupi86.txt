did you think i was a city
big enough for a weekend getaway
i am the town surrounding it
the one youve never heard of
but always pass through
there are no neon lights here
no skyscrapers or statues
but there is thunder
for i make bridges tremble
i am not street meat i am homemade jam
thick enough to cut the sweetest
thing your lips will touch
i am not police sirens
i am the crackle of a fireplace
id burn you and you still
couldnt take your eyes off me
cause id look so beautiful doing it
youd blush
i am not a hotel room i am home
i am not the whiskey you want
i am the water you need
dont come here with expectations
