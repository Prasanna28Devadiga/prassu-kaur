weve been arguing more than we ought to. about things
neither of us remember or care about cause thats how we
avoid the bigger questions. instead of asking why we dont
say i love you to one another as often as we used to. we fight
about things like: who was supposed to get up and turn the
lights off first. or who was supposed to pop the frozen pizza
in the oven after work. taking hits at the most vulnerable parts
of one another. were like fingers on thorns honey. we know
exactly where it hurts.

and everything is on the table tonight. like that one time you
whispered a name im pretty sure wasnt mine in your sleep.
or last week when you said you were working late. so i called
work but they said youd already left a couple hours ago.
where were you for those couple hours.

i know. i know. your excuses make all the sense in the world.
and i get a little carried away for no good reason and
eventually begin crying. but what else do you expect baby. i
love you so much. im sorry i thought you were lying.

thats when you hold your head with your hands in
frustration. half begging me to stop. half tired and sick of it.
the toxin in our mouths has burnt holes in our cheeks. we look
less alive than we used to. less color in our faces. but dont
kid yourself. no matter how bad it gets we both know you
still wanna nail me to the ground.

especially when im screaming so loud our fighting wakes the
neighbors. and they come running to the door to save us. baby
