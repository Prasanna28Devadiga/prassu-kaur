you were the most beautiful thing id ever felt till now. and i
was convinced youd remain the most beautiful thing id ever
feel. do you know how limiting that is. to think at such a ripe
young age id experienced the most exhilarating person id
ever meet. how id spend the rest of my life just settling. to
think id tasted the rawest form of honey and everything else
would be refined and synthetic. that nothing beyond this
point would add up. that all the years beyond me could not
combine themselves to be sweeter than you.
